# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a linear regression model to predict house prices based on various house characteristics using the "House Sales in King County, USA" dataset. The dataset includes features like square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and more, which are used to predict the final sale price of each house. The project follows a structured workflow including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset Information
- **Dataset Name:** House Sales in King County, USA
- **Source:** [Kaggle - House Sales Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)
- **Description:** The dataset consists of detailed records of house sales in King County, USA, which includes Seattle. It contains over 20,000 records and 21 attributes such as the number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square footage, etc., along with the price for each house sold.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Exploration
   - A detailed exploration of the data includes summarizing data types, checking for missing values, and visualizing distributions.
   - Correlation analysis is performed using a heatmap to identify key features influencing the target variable (house price).

### 2. Data Preprocessing
   - Standardization is applied to features to improve model performance.
   - Splitting of data into training and testing sets to ensure fair model evaluation.

### 3. Model Building and Training
   - A linear regression model is trained on the training data to predict house prices.
   - The model is evaluated using various performance metrics to gauge accuracy.

### 4. Model Evaluation
   - Performance is measured using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, and **R-squared (RÂ²)**.
   - Residual plots are analyzed to check the distribution of prediction errors and verify linear regression assumptions.

### 5. Conclusion and Future Work
   - Summary of the model's performance and insights into feature influence on house prices.
   - Suggestions for future improvement include hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and exploring alternative models for better performance.
