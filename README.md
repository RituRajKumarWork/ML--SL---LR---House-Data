# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a linear regression model to predict house prices based on various house characteristics using the "House Sales in King County, USA" dataset. The dataset includes features like square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and more, which are used to predict the final sale price of each house. The project follows a structured workflow including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
